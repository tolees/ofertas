- Overwhelm your foes - by stringing together a massive hit count of relentless combos. Agile attack movements and the power of time are at your disposal in visually-striking, rapid combat. With both classic side-scrolling fights and the new addition of full-3D scenarios, launch enemies into the air and finish them using sword strikes, dashes and impressive ultimate attacks.
- Enhance your attributes with over 100 equipped relics that harness the potential of your abilities. Boost health, critical strikes or strength, and unlock more by undertaking new quests.
- Manipulate time, eliminate enemies and overcome all obstacles. Use techniques, such as Time Stop, Warp, and Reversal to outwit powerful bosses and solve creative puzzles.
- Play as three unique characters including returning heroine Freyja, and newcomers Felix and Bernard, as they journey across dimensions in a desperate struggle against the destruction of the Dark Abyss. The power of the AeternoBlade must be returned or reality, as they know it, will face total collapse.
- Leap, grapple and climb across intricately designed environments with vertical terrain. Find useful new items by exploring multiple routes through mystic ruins, ancient forests, and stoic castles.
